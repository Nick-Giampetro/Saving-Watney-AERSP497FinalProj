# Saving-Watney-AERSP497FinalProj

Project by William Corvino and Nicholas Giampetro

Originally completed for AERSP 497 on 4/29/2024, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

This project contains both Python and MATLAB code. The MATLAB code is an analytical calculation that can determine how much fuel and how long it takes a spacecraft to get to Mars given an initial Delta V and flight path angle. The Python Code is an optimizer utilizing SciPy minimize with the SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, and COBYLA methods to compare the results of these methods on the analytical function that was made in MATLAB.
